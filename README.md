# CFP Workshop

Write better proposals to give talks at tech conferences, specifically focusing on the area of functional programming. Add your draft to the `/proposals` directory, and make a pull request if you want advice. Visit `#cfp-workshop` on the [FP Chat](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/) Slack group to discuss your work in greater detail.

## General advice for writing

If you're stuck for what to write about, instead of trying to _think_ of something, spend time _free writing_, which means thinking _by means of_ writing, not just staring into the middle distance until inspiration strikes you.

What are you working on now? What interesting problems have you recently solved at work? What topics fascinate you, or what would you like to write more about? You just need a prompt and 20 minutes to work out your thoughts on paper (or on the screen). 

Keep writing until an idea or general direction emerges. Sometimes, this happens quickly. Sometimes, it doesn't. If your first attempt goes nowhere, take a break and try again later. Or sleep on it.

Don't rush, don't try to produce a polished, final draft the first time you write anything, and don't procrastinate until you're left trying to finish your proposal right before it's due.
